# Time Series I/O

This project implements a simple Time Series object and interfaces for reading and writing these objects with MongoDB.
It also provides a generalized reading interface. This 'interface' is a class that receives specific objects upon its
instantiation. These objects are then used for reading Time Series data from external sources.

## Requirements
