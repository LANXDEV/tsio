# Time Series I/O

This project implements a simple Time Series object and an interface for reading and writing these objects with MongoDB.
It also provides a generalized reading interface. This 'interface' is a class that receives specific reader objects upon
its instantiation. These objects are then used for reading Time Series data from external sources.

Check the project's [Documentation](https://lanxdev.github.io/tsio/index).
